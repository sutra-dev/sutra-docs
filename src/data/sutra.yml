        The name of the model to use for generation. Available models include:


        - `sutra-v2`: A multilingual AI model designed for instruction execution
        and conversational intelligence across 50+ languages. 

        Trained on a diverse blend of proprietary and open-access datasets, it
        excels in handling complex tasks with high accuracy. 

        With deep proficiency across Latin, Indic, and Far Eastern languages,
        SUTRA-V2 delivers natural, context-aware responses, 

        making it a powerful solution for global enterprises, multilingual
        assistants, and cross-language AI applications.


        - `sutra-r0`: The first in our series of advanced reasoning models,
        designed for complex problem-solving and deep contextual understanding. 

        Built to analyze, infer, and generate logical responses, SUTRA-R0 goes
        beyond pattern recognition—applying structured reasoning to tackle 

        nuanced queries, multi-step problem-solving, and enterprise
        decision-making. Its architecture enables high-accuracy responses across
        domains, 

        making it a powerful tool for knowledge-intensive workflows and
        next-generation AI applications.

        This endpoint supports both SUTRA-V2 and SUTRA-R0 models, each optimized
        for different use cases.

        Use SUTRA-V2 for multilingual applications across 50+ languages, or
        SUTRA-R0 for advanced reasoning

        and complex problem-solving tasks requiring deep contextual
        understanding.


        There are two forms of reply as determined by the `stream` parameter:

        - `stream` is `false` or not set - the reply is a `CompletionSequence`
        object.


        - `stream` is `true` - the reply is `CompletionStream` delivered as
        server-sent events (SSE),

        each event containing a `CompletionChunk` object.
