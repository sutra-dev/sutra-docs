## SUTRA by TWO Platforms

SUTRA is a family of large multi-lingual language models (LMLMs) pioneered
by Two Platforms. SUTRA’s dual-transformer approach extends the power of
both MoE and Dense AI language model architectures, delivering
cost-efficient multilingual capabilities for over 50+ languages. It powers
scalable AI applications for conversation, search, and advanced reasoning,
ensuring high-performance across diverse languages, domains and
applications.

## What is Agno?

Agno is a lightweight library for building agents with memory,
knowledge, tools, and reasoning capabilities. It's model-agnostic,
allowing you to connect to 23+ model providers without lock-in.

## Get Your API Keys

Before you begin, make sure you have:

1.  A SUTRA API key (Get yours at [TWO AI's SUTRA API
    page](https://www.two.ai/sutra/api))
2.  Basic familiarity with Python and Jupyter notebooks

This notebook is designed to run in Google Colab, so no local Python
installation is required.

## Setup and Installation

First, let's install the required packages:

```python
# SUTRA models are OpenAI API compatible
!pip install openai agno duckduckgo-search
```

## Setting up Environment Variables

You'll need to set up your API keys. For security reasons, it's best to
use environment variables:

```python
import os
from google.colab import userdata

# Set the API key from Colab secrets
os.environ["SUTRA_API_KEY"] = userdata.get("SUTRA_API_KEY")
os.environ["TAVILY_API_KEY"] = userdata.get("TAVILY_API_KEY")
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = userdata.get("OPENAI_API_KEY")
```

## Basic Usage of SUTRA with OpenAI Client

Let's first see how to use SUTRA with the standard OpenAI client:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

# Initialize the client with Sutra's API endpoint
client = OpenAI(
    base_url='https://api.two.ai/v2',
    api_key=os.environ["SUTRA_API_KEY"]
)

# Simple completion with Sutra
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="sutra-v2",  # Use Sutra model
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant that specializes in Indian languages and culture."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Tell me about the importance of the Ganga river in Indian culture."}
    ]
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

## Multilingual Capabilities of SUTRA

One of Sutra's strengths is its multilingual capabilities. Let's test it
with Hindi:

```python
# Hindi example
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="sutra-v2",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "आप एक सहायक AI हैं जो हिंदी में उत्तर देती है।"},
        {"role": "user", "content": "भारतीय संस्कृति में गंगा नदी का क्या महत्व है?"}
    ]
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

## Integrating SUTRA with Agno Agent

Now, let's integrate Sutra with Agno to create an intelligent agent.
We'll create a custom OpenAI model class for Agno that uses Sutra:

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai.like import OpenAILike

# Initialize the Agent with Sutra model via OpenAILike wrapper
agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAILike(
        id="sutra-v2",
        api_key=os.getenv("SUTRA_API_KEY"),
        base_url="https://api.two.ai/v2"
    ),
    markdown=True
)

# Create a basic Sutra agent
sutra_agent = Agent(
    description="You are a helpful assistant that specializes in Indian languages and culture.",
    markdown=True
)

# Test the agent
sutra_agent.print_response("Tell me about the history of yoga in India.", stream=True)
```

## Adding Tools to the SUTRA Agent

Let's enhance our Sutra agent by adding tools, such as web search
capabilities:

```python
from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools

# Create a Sutra agent with web search capability
sutra_agent_with_tools = Agent(
    description="You are a helpful assistant that specializes in Indian languages, culture, and current events.",
    tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()],
    show_tool_calls=True,
    markdown=True
)

# Test the agent with a query that might require web search
sutra_agent_with_tools.print_response("What are the recent developments in India's space program in hindi?", stream=True)
```

## Creating a Multilingual SUTRA Agent with Reasoning

Now, let's create a more advanced SUTRA agent that can handle multiple
languages and has reasoning capabilities:

```python
from agno.tools.reasoning import ReasoningTools

# Create a multilingual Sutra agent with reasoning capabilities
multilingual_sutra_agent = Agent(
    description="You are a multilingual assistant that can communicate in various Indian languages and has strong reasoning abilities.",
    tools=[
        ReasoningTools(add_instructions=True),
        DuckDuckGoTools()
    ],
    instructions=[
        "You can respond in the language used by the user.",
        "Use reasoning to analyze complex questions before answering.",
        "If needed, search the web for current information."
    ],
    show_tool_calls=True,
    markdown=True
)

# Test with a complex reasoning task in English
multilingual_sutra_agent.print_response(
    "Analyze the impact of climate change on agricultural practices in India. What adaptations are farmers making?",
    stream=True,
    show_full_reasoning=True
)
```

```python
# Test with a Hindi query
multilingual_sutra_agent.print_response(
    "भारत में जलवायु परिवर्तन का कृषि पर क्या प्रभाव पड़ रहा है? किसान कैसे अनुकूलन कर रहे हैं?",
    stream=True,
    show_full_reasoning=True
)
```

## Conclusion

In this notebook, we've demonstrated how to use the Sutra model with the
OpenAI client and integrate it with Agno to create intelligent agents.
We've explored:

1.  Basic usage of Sutra with the OpenAI client
2.  Multilingual capabilities of SUTRA
3.  Creating a simple Sutra agent with Agno
4.  Adding tools like web search to the SUTRA agent
5.  Building a multilingual SUTRA agent with reasoning capabilities

Sutra's strong multilingual capabilities, especially for Indian
languages, combined with Agno's flexible agent framework, provide a
powerful platform for building intelligent applications that can
understand and respond in multiple languages and leverage various tools
and knowledge sources.
