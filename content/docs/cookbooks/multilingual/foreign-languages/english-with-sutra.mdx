## Introduction

In this notebook, we demonstrate how to use the Sutra model with the
OpenAI client specifically for English language applications. Sutra
excels in processing and generating content in Indian languages, making
it an ideal choice for English language tasks.

### What You Will Learn

- Setting up the OpenAI client to work with the Sutra model
- Creating prompts in English and understanding the responses
- Exploring various English language use cases
- Best practices for generating content in English

## Get Your API Keys

Before you begin, make sure you have:

1.  A SUTRA API key (Get yours at [TWO AI's SUTRA API
    page](https://developer.two.ai))
2.  Basic familiarity with Python and Jupyter notebooks

This notebook is designed to run in Google Colab, so no local Python
installation is required.

## Setup

First, install the required libraries.

```python
# SUTRA models are OpenAI API compatible
!pip install openai
```

### Import required libraries

```python
# Import required libraries
import os
import time
from openai import OpenAI
from IPython.display import display, Markdown, HTML
from google.colab import userdata
```

## Authentication

To use the Sutra API, you need to set your API key.

```python
# If you want to use it in code, for example:
os.environ["SUTRA_API_KEY"] = userdata.get('SUTRA_API_KEY')
```

### Create OpenAI Client with Sutra API Endpoint

```python
# Create OpenAI Client with Sutra API Endpoint
client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://api.two.ai/v2",
    api_key=os.environ.get("SUTRA_API_KEY")
)
```

## Helper Functions

Create helper functions to interact with the Sutra API for English
language tasks.

```python
import time
from IPython.display import display, HTML

def get_sutra_response(prompt, model="sutra-v2", temperature=0.7, max_tokens=1024):
    """Simple non-streaming response from Sutra AI"""
    try:
        start_time = time.time()

        # Basic API call
        response = client.chat.completions.create(
            model=model,
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
            temperature=temperature,
            max_tokens=max_tokens
        )

        # Get the response content
        result = response.choices[0].message.content
        time_taken = time.time() - start_time

        # Simple display
        print(f"Prompt: {prompt}")
        print(f"Response: {result}")
        print(f"Time taken: {time_taken:.2f}s")

        return result, time_taken

    except Exception as e:
        error_msg = f"Error: {str(e)}"
        print(error_msg)
        return error_msg, 0

def get_sutra_streaming_response(prompt, model="sutra-v2", temperature=0.7, max_tokens=1024):
    """Simple streaming response from Sutra AI"""
    try:
        start_time = time.time()

        # Start streaming
        stream = client.chat.completions.create(
            model=model,
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
            temperature=temperature,
            max_tokens=max_tokens,
            stream=True
        )

        print(f"Prompt: {prompt}")
        print("Response:", end=" ")

        full_response = ""

        # Print chunks as they come
        for chunk in stream:
            if chunk.choices[0].delta.content:
                content = chunk.choices[0].delta.content
                print(content, end="", flush=True)
                full_response += content

        time_taken = time.time() - start_time
        print(f"\nTime taken: {time_taken:.2f}s")

        return full_response

    except Exception as e:
        error_msg = f"Error: {str(e)}"
        print(error_msg)
        return error_msg
```

## 1. Basic English Language Generation

Let's start with some basic examples of generating English text with
Sutra.

```python
# Simple English Text Generation
english_prompt = "Hello, my name is Rahul. How are you?"

response, time_taken = get_sutra_response(english_prompt)
```

## 2. Information Retrieval in English

Let's use Sutra to retrieve information in English.

```python
# Information Retrieval in English
info_prompt = "Tell me about the five major festivals of India and highlight their significance."

response, time_taken = get_sutra_response(info_prompt)
```

## 3. Creative Writing in English

Sutra can generate creative content in English.

```python
# Creative Writing in English
creative_prompt = "Write a short poem about the Himalayas."

response, time_taken = get_sutra_response(creative_prompt, temperature=0.8)
```

## 4. Summarization in English

Sutra can effectively summarize English text.

```python
# Text for Summarization
long_text = """
The history of India's independence is long and complex. British rule in India began in 1757 after the Battle of Plassey, when the East India Company defeated the Nawab of Bengal, Siraj-ud-Daula. Subsequently, the company gradually expanded its area of influence, and by 1858, India came directly under the British Crown.

The 1857 rebellion, also known as the First War of Independence, was the first major revolt against British rule. Although this rebellion failed, it awakened national consciousness among Indians.

With the formation of the Indian National Congress in 1885, the independence movement became more organized. Under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, demands for independence were made through non-violent resistance and Satyagraha.

In 1942, the 'Quit India Movement' was launched, forcing the British to leave India. After World War II, Britain's economic condition weakened, and eventually, India gained independence on August 15, 1947, although the country was partitioned into India and Pakistan.
"""

summarize_prompt = f"Summarize the following text in less than 100 words:\n\n{long_text}"

summary, time_taken = get_sutra_response(summarize_prompt, temperature=0.3)
```

## 5. Question-Answering in English

Let's use Sutra for question-answering in English.

```python
# Context for Question-Answering
context = """
The Constitution of India is the longest written constitution in the world. It was adopted on November 26, 1949, and came into effect on January 26, 1950. Dr. B. R. Ambedkar is considered the chief architect of the Indian Constitution. The original constitution had 395 articles, 22 parts, and 8 schedules. Currently, it has 448 articles, 25 parts, and 12 schedules. The words 'Socialist', 'Secular', and 'Integrity' were added to the preamble by the 42nd Amendment (1976).
"""

qa_prompt = f"Answer the following questions based on the information provided:\n\n{context}\n\nQuestion 1: When did the Indian Constitution come into effect?\nQuestion 2: Who was the chief architect of the Indian Constitution?\nQuestion 3: Which words were added to the preamble by the 42nd Amendment?"

answers, time_taken = get_sutra_response(qa_prompt, temperature=0.2)
```

## 6. English-Hindi Translation

Sutra can effectively translate between Hindi and English.

```python
# Hindi to English Translation
hindi_text = "भारत एक विविधतापूर्ण देश है जहाँ कई भाषाएँ, धर्म और संस्कृतियाँ एक साथ विकसित होती हैं। इसकी समृद्ध परंपराएँ और इतिहास इसे दुनिया में एक अनोखा स्थान देते हैं।"

translate_hi_to_en_prompt = f"Translate the following Hindi text into English:\n\n{hindi_text}"

translation_en, time_taken = get_sutra_response(translate_hi_to_en_prompt)
```

```python
# English to Hindi Translation
english_text = "Artificial intelligence is transforming the way we live and work. It has applications in healthcare, education, transportation, and many other fields. As technology advances, it's important to ensure that AI is developed ethically and responsibly."

translate_en_to_hi_prompt = f"Translate the following English text into Hindi:\n\n{english_text}"

translation_hi, time_taken = get_sutra_response(translate_en_to_hi_prompt)
```

## 7. English Sentiment Analysis

Let's use Sutra to perform sentiment analysis on English text.

```python
# English Reviews for Sentiment Analysis
reviews = [
    "This movie was very good. The story was engaging and the acting was excellent.",
    "The food was not at all tasty and the service was very poor.",
    "The product is okay, but the price is a bit high.",
    "I liked this book, the author explained the topic very well.",
    "The trip was disappointing, the hotel was dirty and the staff was unfriendly."
]

sentiment_prompt = "Perform sentiment analysis on the following English reviews and classify each as 'Positive', 'Negative', or 'Neutral':\n\n"

for i, review in enumerate(reviews):
    sentiment_prompt += f"{i+1}. {review}\n"

sentiment_analysis, time_taken = get_sutra_response(sentiment_prompt, temperature=0.1)
```

## 8. English Content Generation for Various Formats

Sutra can generate English content in various formats.

```python
# Generate English blog post
blog_prompt = "Write a blog post on the topic 'Indian Cuisine and Its Impact on Health'. Include a title, introduction, main points, and conclusion."

blog_post = get_sutra_streaming_response(blog_prompt, temperature=0.7)
```
