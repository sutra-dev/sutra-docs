## Introduction

SUTRA offers several specialized model variants, each designed for
specific use cases and capabilities. This notebook explores the features
of each Sutra model variant and provides examples of how to use them
effectively in your applications.

## Best Practices for Using SUTRA Models

Here are some best practices for getting the most out of Sutra model
variants:

1.  **Select the right model for your task**:
    - Use SUTRA-V2 for multilingual applications and general
      conversational AI
    - Use SUTRA-R0 for complex reasoning and problem-solving
    - Use SUTRA-Q0 (Enterprise) for time-series analysis and forecasting
2.  **Optimize your prompts**:
    - Be specific and clear in your instructions
    - Provide context when necessary
    - Use examples to guide the model's output format
3.  **Adjust temperature settings**:
    - Lower temperature (0-0.3) for more deterministic, focused
      responses
    - Higher temperature (0.7-1.0) for more creative, varied responses
4.  **Consider token limits**:
    - Be mindful of input and output token limits
    - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable chunks

## Get Your API Keys

Before you begin, make sure you have:

1.  A SUTRA API key (Get yours at [TWO AI's SUTRA API
    page](https://www.two.ai/sutra/api))
2.  Basic familiarity with Python and Jupyter notebooks

This notebook is designed to run in Google Colab, so no local Python
installation is required.

## Setup

First, let's install the necessary libraries and set up our environment.

```python
# SUTRA models are OpenAI API compatible
!pip install openai requests
```

### Import necessary libraries

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import os
from openai import OpenAI
from IPython.display import display, Markdown, HTML
from google.colab import userdata
```

## Authentication

To use the Sutra API, you need to set up your API key.

Set up authentication using Colab secrets.

```python
# Get API key from Colab secrets
os.environ["SUTRA_API_KEY"] = userdata.get('SUTRA_API_KEY')
```

### Create the OpenAI client with Sutra

```python
# Create the OpenAI client with Sutra's API endpoint
client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://api.two.ai/v2",
    api_key=os.environ.get("SUTRA_API_KEY")
)
```

## Helper Function

Let's create a helper function to interact with the Sutra API.

```python
def get_model_response(model, prompt, temperature=0, max_tokens=1024):
    """
    Get a response from a specified Sutra model.

    Args:
        model (str): The model identifier (e.g., "sutra-v2", "sutra-r0")
        prompt (str): The user prompt or question
        temperature (float): Controls randomness (0 to 1)
        max_tokens (int): Maximum number of tokens to generate

    Returns:
        str: The model's response
    """
    try:
        response = client.chat.completions.create(
            model=model,
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
            max_tokens=max_tokens,
            temperature=temperature
        )

        return response.choices[0].message.content

    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error: {str(e)}"
```

## SUTRA-V2: Multilingual AI Model

SUTRA-V2 is a powerful multilingual AI model designed for instruction
execution and conversational intelligence across 50+ languages. It
excels in handling complex tasks with high accuracy and has deep
proficiency across Latin, Indic, and Far Eastern languages.

### Key Features

- Support for 50+ languages
- Conversational intelligence
- Instruction following
- Context-aware responses
- Natural language understanding

### Example: Multilingual Capabilities

Let's explore SUTRA-V2's multilingual capabilities with examples in
different languages.

```python
# Define prompts in different languages
multilingual_examples = {
    "English": "Explain the concept of artificial intelligence in simple terms.",
    "Hindi": "कृत्रिम बुद्धिमत्ता की अवधारणा को सरल शब्दों में समझाएं।",
    "Spanish": "Explica el concepto de inteligencia artificial en términos simples.",
    "Chinese": "用简单的术语解释人工智能的概念。",
    "Arabic": "اشرح مفهوم الذكاء الاصطناعي بمصطلحات بسيطة."
}

# Get responses from SUTRA-V2
for language, prompt in multilingual_examples.items():
    print(f"\n--- {language} Example ---")
    print(f"Prompt: {prompt}")

    response = get_model_response("sutra-v2", prompt)
    print(f"\nResponse:\n{response}")
    print("-" * 50)
```

### Example: Creative Writing

SUTRA-V2 can also be used for creative writing tasks across different
languages.

```python
creative_prompt = "Write a short poem about the changing seasons."

print("Creative Writing Example:")
print(f"Prompt: {creative_prompt}")

response = get_model_response("sutra-v2", creative_prompt, temperature=0.7)
print(f"\nResponse:\n{response}")
```

## SUTRA-R0: Advanced Reasoning Model

SUTRA-R0 is designed for complex problem-solving and deep contextual
understanding. It applies structured reasoning to tackle nuanced
queries, multi-step problem-solving, and enterprise decision-making.

### Key Features

- Complex problem-solving
- Logical reasoning
- Multi-step decision processes
- Deep contextual understanding
- High-accuracy responses across domains

### Example: Logical Reasoning

Let's explore SUTRA-R0's reasoning capabilities with logical problems.

```python
reasoning_examples = [
    "Solve the following logical puzzle: If all A are B, and some B are C, what can we conclude about A and C?",
    "A ball and a bat cost $1.10 in total. The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?",
    "Analyze the following argument and identify any logical fallacies: 'All birds can fly. Penguins are birds. Therefore, penguins can fly.'"
]

for i, prompt in enumerate(reasoning_examples):
    print(f"\n--- Reasoning Example {i+1} ---")
    print(f"Prompt: {prompt}")

    response = get_model_response("sutra-r0", prompt)
    print(f"\nResponse:\n{response}")
    print("-" * 50)
```

### Example: Step-by-Step Problem Solving

SUTRA-R0 excels at breaking down complex problems into manageable steps.

```python
problem_solving_prompt = """
Explain how to solve this physics problem step by step:
A car accelerates from rest at a constant rate of 3 m/s². How far will it travel in 10 seconds?
"""

print("Step-by-Step Problem Solving Example:")
print(f"Prompt: {problem_solving_prompt}")

response = get_model_response("sutra-r0", problem_solving_prompt)
print(f"\nResponse:\n{response}")
```

## SUTRA-Q0: Time-Series Large Quantitative Model

SUTRA-Q0 is a time-series Large Quantitative Model (LQM) built for
forecasting and analytical applications beyond text and chat. It's
optimized for dynamic data patterns and enables enterprises to predict
trends, detect anomalies, and make data-driven decisions.

> Note: SUTRA-Q0 is available to SUTRA Enterprise customers.

### Key Features

- Time-series forecasting
- Anomaly detection
- Pattern recognition in data

### Example: Time-Series Analysis

For enterprise users with access to SUTRA-Q0, here's an example of how
you might use it for time-series analysis.

```python
# Note: This is a demonstration of how you might use SUTRA-Q0 if you have enterprise access
time_series_prompt = """
Analyze this time series data and identify trends and patterns:
[10, 12, 15, 14, 16, 19, 22, 21, 24, 27, 26, 29, 33, 32, 35, 38]

What forecast would you make for the next 5 data points?
"""

print("Time-Series Analysis Example (Enterprise Feature):")
print(f"Prompt: {time_series_prompt}")

# For demonstration purposes only - actual enterprise users would use "sutra-q0"
response = get_model_response("sutra-v2", time_series_prompt)
print(f"\nResponse:\n{response}")
```

### Example: Anomaly Detection

Another powerful capability of SUTRA-Q0 is anomaly detection in
datasets.

```python
# Note: This is a demonstration of how you might use SUTRA-Q0 if you have enterprise access
anomaly_prompt = """
Identify any anomalies in this dataset and explain your reasoning:
[100, 102, 98, 103, 99, 101, 250, 97, 104, 100, 103, 97, 101]
"""

print("Anomaly Detection Example (Enterprise Feature):")
print(f"Prompt: {anomaly_prompt}")

# For demonstration purposes only - actual enterprise users would use "sutra-q0"
response = get_model_response("sutra-v2", anomaly_prompt)
print(f"\nResponse:\n{response}")
```
