## Introduction

This beginner-friendly notebook shows you how to use Sutra's streaming
feature with the OpenAI client. Streaming lets you see responses as
they're being generated (word by word), instead of waiting for the
complete response.

### Why Use Streaming?

- **Feels faster**: Users see text appearing immediately
- **More interactive**: Creates a more natural conversation experience
- **Better for long responses**: Users can start reading while the rest
  is being generated

## Get Your API Keys

Before you begin, make sure you have:

1.  A SUTRA API key (Get yours at [TWO AI's SUTRA API
    page](https://www.two.ai/sutra/api))
2.  Basic familiarity with Python and Jupyter notebooks

This notebook is designed to run in Google Colab, so no local Python
installation is required.

## Setup

Install necessary packages and set up the environment.

```python
# SUTRA models are OpenAI API compatible
!pip install -q openai
```

### Import necessary libraries

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import os
import json
import re
from openai import OpenAI
from google.colab import userdata
```

### Authentication

Set up authentication using Colab secrets.

```python
# Get API key from Colab secrets
api_key = userdata.get("SUTRA_API_KEY")
```

### Initialize the client with SUTRA's API endpoint

```python
# Initialize the client
client = OpenAI(
        base_url='https://api.two.ai/v2',
        api_key=api_key
    )
```

## 2. Basic Streaming - Your First Example

Let's create a simple function to stream responses from Sutra.

```python
def stream_response(prompt):
    print("Streaming response...")

    stream = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="sutra-v2",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
        temperature=0.7,
        max_tokens=500,
        stream=True
    )

    full_response = ""
    for chunk in stream:
        if chunk.choices[0].delta.content:
            content = chunk.choices[0].delta.content
            full_response += content
            print(content, end="", flush=True)

    print("\n\n--- Done! ---")
    return full_response
```

### Now let's try it with a simple question:

```python
# Try our streaming function with a simple prompt
prompt = "Explain what artificial intelligence is to a 10-year old."
response = stream_response(prompt)
```

## 3. Having a Conversation

Now let's try having a back-and-forth conversation with streaming
responses.

```python
def chat_with_streaming(messages):
    """Have a conversation with streaming responses"""
    print("Streaming response...")

    stream = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="sutra-v2",
        messages=messages,  # Pass the entire conversation history
        temperature=0.7,
        max_tokens=500,
        stream=True
    )

    full_response = ""
    for chunk in stream:
        if chunk.choices[0].delta.content is not None:
            content = chunk.choices[0].delta.content
            full_response += content
            print(content, end="", flush=True)

    print("\n\n--- Done! ---")
    return full_response
```

```python
# Start a conversation
conversation = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Tell me about some popular Indian street foods."}
]

# First message
print("You: Tell me about some popular Indian street foods.")
print("\nSutra: ", end="")
response = chat_with_streaming(conversation)

# Add the response to our conversation history
conversation.append({"role": "assistant", "content": response})

# Second message - follow up question
conversation.append({"role": "user", "content": "Which one of these is your favorite and why?"})

print("\nYou: Which one of these is your favorite and why?")
print("\nSutra: ", end="")
response = chat_with_streaming(conversation)
```

## 4. Simple Word Counter

Let's create a simple example that counts words as they're being
generated.

```python
def simple_stream_with_word_count(prompt):
    """Stream response and display word count"""
    print("Streaming response...")

    stream = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="sutra-v2",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
        temperature=0.7,
        max_tokens=500,
        stream=True
    )

    full_response = ""

    for chunk in stream:
        if chunk.choices[0].delta.content is not None:
            content = chunk.choices[0].delta.content
            full_response += content
            print(content, end="", flush=True)

    words = full_response.split()
    print(f"\n\n[Total words: {len(words)}]")
    print("--- Done! ---")
    return full_response
```

### Try the word counter

```python
# Try the word counter
prompt = "Write a short paragraph about the importance of clean water."
response = simple_stream_with_word_count(prompt)
```

## 5. Handling Errors

Let's create a simple function that handles errors when streaming.

```python
def safe_stream(prompt):
    """Stream response with simple fallback on error"""
    try:
        print("Streaming response...")
        stream = client.chat.completions.create(
            model="sutra-v2",
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
            temperature=0.7,
            max_tokens=500,
            stream=True
        )

        full_response = ""
        for chunk in stream:
            if chunk.choices[0].delta.content:
                content = chunk.choices[0].delta.content
                full_response += content
                print(content, end="", flush=True)

        print("\n\n--- Done! ---")
        return full_response

    except:
        print("\nError during streaming. Falling back...")
        try:
            response = client.chat.completions.create(
                model="sutra-v2",
                messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
                temperature=0.7,
                max_tokens=500
            )
            result = response.choices[0].message.content
            print(result)
            print("\n--- Done (fallback) ---")
            return result
        except:
            return "Sorry, something went wrong. Please try again."
```

### Try our error-handling function

```python
# Try our error-handling function
prompt = "What is Transformer Architecture form in simple terms."
response = safe_stream(prompt)
```

## 6. Practical Example: Interactive Story

Let's create a simple interactive story generator that you can try out.

```python
def interactive_story():
    """Simple interactive story generator"""
    print("=== Interactive Story Generator ===\n")
    print("Create a short story with your input.")
    print("You can guide the direction after each paragraph.\n")

    # Ask for the initial story idea
    story_idea = input("What should the story be about? ")

    # Initialize the conversation
    conversation = [
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a creative storyteller. Write vivid and engaging stories one paragraph at a time."},
        {"role": "user", "content": f"Write the first paragraph of a short story about {story_idea}. Keep it to 3–5 sentences."}
    ]

    # Generate the story in 3 parts
    for i in range(3):
        print(f"\n--- Paragraph {i + 1} ---\n")

        # Generate and display the paragraph
        response = chat_with_streaming(conversation)
        conversation.append({"role": "assistant", "content": response})

        # Ask for user input to guide the next part
        if i < 2:
            direction = input("\nWhat should happen next? ")
            conversation.append({
                "role": "user",
                "content": f"Continue the story with this idea: {direction}. Keep it to one paragraph (3–5 sentences)."
            })

    print("\n=== Story Complete! ===")
    return "Story complete!"
```

# interactive story generator

```python
interactive_story()
```

```json
{ "type": "string" }
```
