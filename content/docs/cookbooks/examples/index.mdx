Welcome! This directory contains example notebooks that showcase how to use [SUTRA](https://www.two.ai/sutra) in real-world scenarios and compare its performance to other leading models.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Hands-on example notebooks**: Explore SUTRA's capabilities and compare with OpenAI models
- **Best practices**: See recommended patterns for evaluation and benchmarking

## Included Notebooks

- [SUTRA vs OpenAI Models](sutra_vs_openai_models.ipynb) ([Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/175pEoGuZX_6s2lxzXiiT4lYS76QIdg-k?usp=sharing)) — Compare SUTRA V2 and OpenAI models across a variety of tasks and metrics

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Familiarity with Jupyter or Google Colab (recommended)
- [Get your SUTRA API key](https://developer.two.ai) (free for signup)
- OpenAI API key (for comparison)

## How to Use

1. **Open the notebook above in Google Colab** (recommended) or your local Jupyter environment.
2. **Install dependencies** (see the first cell in the notebook).
3. **Add your SUTRA and OpenAI API keys** when prompted (Colab: use the secret manager for best security).
4. **Run the cells and explore the results!**
