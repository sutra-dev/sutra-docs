Welcome! This directory showcases how to connect [SUTRA](https://www.two.ai/sutra)—a powerful multilingual language model family by TWO AI—with leading frameworks and agentic platforms. These integration notebooks help you leverage SUTRA's capabilities in your own LLM-powered workflows, apps, and pipelines.

## What You'll Find Here

- **LlamaIndex integration**: Use SUTRA as an LLM backend for data-augmented agents and retrieval workflows
- **LangChain integration**: Build advanced chains, tools, and conversational agents with SUTRA
- **Agno integration**: Create agentic, multimodal, and memory-augmented workflows with SUTRA

## Included Notebooks

- [Sutra with LlamaIndex](sutra_with_llamaindex.ipynb) ([Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Shubhwithai/sutra-cookbook/blob/main/integrations/sutra_with_llamaindex.ipynb))
- [Sutra with LangChain](sutra_with_langchain.ipynb) ([Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Shubhwithai/sutra-cookbook/blob/main/integrations/sutra_with_langchain.ipynb))
- [Sutra with Agno](sutra_with_agno.ipynb) ([Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Shubhwithai/sutra-cookbook/blob/main/integrations/sutra_with_agno.ipynb))

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Familiarity with Jupyter or Google Colab (recommended)
- [Get your SUTRA API key](https://developer.two.ai) (free for signup)
- API keys for other frameworks (e.g., OpenAI, Tavily) as needed

## How to Use

1. **Open any notebook above in Google Colab** (recommended) or your local Jupyter environment.
2. **Install dependencies** (see the first cell in each notebook).
3. **Add your SUTRA API key** and any other required keys when prompted (Colab: use the secret manager for best security).
4. **Run the cells and experiment!**

## Next Steps

Explore the rest of the Sutra Cookbook for more advanced use cases, prompt engineering, and real-world applications.
