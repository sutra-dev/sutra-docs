title: SUTRA Reasoning Capabilities
---

This guide dives into **SUTRA-R0’s reasoning capabilities**, designed for structured thinking and complex decision-making across domains like finance, healthcare, and customer service. SUTRA-R0 excels in multi-step problem-solving and nuanced analysis.

## 🧠 Reasoning Overview

SUTRA-R0, built with a logical reasoning layer, outperforms models like DeepSeek-R1-32B and OpenAI-o1-mini in multilingual tasks (e.g., Hindi: 81.44, Gujarati: 79.39). Its structured reasoning framework supports enterprise applications by interpreting complex scenarios and generating actionable insights.[](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2025/02/sutra-r0/)[](https://analyticsindiamag.com/ai-news-updates/jio-backed-two-ai-launches-multilingual-reasoning-model-sutra-r0/)

## 📦 Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
# SUTRA models are OpenAI API compatible
!pip install -qU openai
```

## 🔐 Step 2: Initialize SUTRA Client

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    api_key="YOUR_SUTRA_API_KEY",
    base_url="https://api.two.ai/v2"
)
```

## 💬 Step 3: Reasoning Example

```python
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="sutra-r0",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a reasoning expert. Break down the query into logical steps."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "If a contract states 'Party A is liable unless Party B notifies within 7 days,' who is liable if notice is given on day 8?"}
    ],
    max_tokens=1024,
    temperature=0.7
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

## 🌟 Use Cases

- **Financial Services**: Risk assessment and market trend analysis.
- **Healthcare**: Medical data analysis and diagnostic support.
- **Customer Service**: Intelligent response recommendations for complex inquiries.

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

- **Invalid API Key**: Verify your key at [https://developer.two.ai](https://developer.two.ai).
- **Model Not Found**: Use `sutra-r0`. SUTRA-V1 was deprecated on March 22, 2025.[](https://www.two.ai/blog/sutra-v2-is-here)
- **Incomplete Responses**: Increase `max_tokens` or refine the prompt for clarity.
