This guide provides a high-level overview of the key features of **SUTRA**, a family of multilingual AI models by TWO AI, designed for conversation, reasoning, and quantitative tasks. SUTRAâ€™s innovative architecture powers scalable, cost-efficient, and enterprise-ready applications across diverse domains.

## ðŸŒŸ Key Features

### Multilingual Capabilities

SUTRA supports over 50 languages, including Hindi, Gujarati, Tamil, Korean, Arabic, and more, with superior performance on the Multilingual MMLU benchmark. Its dual-transformer architecture decouples concept and language learning, enabling fluent, context-aware responses in diverse linguistic landscapes.[](https://www.two.ai/sutra)[](https://indiaai.gov.in/article/two-platforms-unveiled-sutra-a-novel-multilingual-large-language-model)

### Advanced Reasoning

SUTRA-R0 introduces a structured reasoning framework for complex decision-making and multi-step problem-solving, outperforming models like DeepSeek-R1-32B and OpenAI-o1-mini in languages like Hindi (81.44) and Gujarati (79.39). Itâ€™s ideal for enterprise applications in finance, healthcare, and customer service.[](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2025/02/sutra-r0/)[](https://analyticsindiamag.com/ai-news-updates/jio-backed-two-ai-launches-multilingual-reasoning-model-sutra-r0/)

### Streaming Mode

SUTRA-V2 supports real-time response streaming, ensuring low-latency interactions for dynamic applications like chatbots and live assistants, with optimized servers in India, the USA, Korea, and Japan (coming soon).[](https://www.two.ai/blog/sutra-v2-is-here)

### Quantitative Analysis

SUTRA-Q0, a time-series quantitative model, excels in forecasting, anomaly detection, and trend analysis for domains like finance, logistics, and healthcare, leveraging a dense architecture for dynamic data patterns.[](https://www.two.ai/sutra)
