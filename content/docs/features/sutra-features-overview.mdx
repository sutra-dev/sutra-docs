This guide provides a high-level overview of the key features of **SUTRA**, a family of multilingual AI models by TWO AI, designed for conversation, reasoning, and quantitative tasks. SUTRA’s innovative architecture powers scalable, cost-efficient, and enterprise-ready applications across diverse domains.

## 🌟 Key Features

### Multilingual Capabilities

SUTRA supports over 50 languages, including Hindi, Gujarati, Tamil, Korean, Arabic, and more, with superior performance on the Multilingual MMLU benchmark. Its dual-transformer architecture decouples concept and language learning, enabling fluent, context-aware responses in diverse linguistic landscapes.[](https://www.two.ai/sutra)[](https://indiaai.gov.in/article/two-platforms-unveiled-sutra-a-novel-multilingual-large-language-model)

### Advanced Reasoning

SUTRA-R0 introduces a structured reasoning framework for complex decision-making and multi-step problem-solving, outperforming models like DeepSeek-R1-32B and OpenAI-o1-mini in languages like Hindi (81.44) and Gujarati (79.39). It’s ideal for enterprise applications in finance, healthcare, and customer service.[](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2025/02/sutra-r0/)[](https://analyticsindiamag.com/ai-news-updates/jio-backed-two-ai-launches-multilingual-reasoning-model-sutra-r0/)
