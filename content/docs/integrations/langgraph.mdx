title: LangGraph with SUTRA
---

This guide walks you through using **SUTRA models (V2 or R0)** within the **LangGraph** ecosystem to build stateful, graph-based AI workflows. With LangGraph, you can create dynamic agents, tools, and multi-step processes that leverage SUTRA’s multilingual and reasoning capabilities.

## 📦 Step 1: Install Dependencies

Install the latest versions of LangChain, LangGraph, and OpenAI-compatible packages:

```bash
# SUTRA models are OpenAI API compatible
!pip install -qU openai langchain langchain-openai langchain-community langgraph
```

## 🔐 Step 2: Authenticate with Your API Key

Obtain your SUTRA API key from [https://www.two.ai/sutra/api](https://www.two.ai/sutra/api).

```python
from openai import OpenAI
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

api_key = "YOUR_SUTRA_API_KEY"
```

## ⚙️ Step 3: Initialize LangChain Client with SUTRA

Configure a LangChain `ChatOpenAI` instance to use either `sutra-v2` for multilingual chat or `sutra-r0` for advanced reasoning.

```python
chat = ChatOpenAI(
    model="sutra-v2",  # or "sutra-r0" for reasoning tasks
    api_key=api_key,
    base_url="https://api.two.ai/v2"
)
```

## 🧬 Step 4: Build a Simple LangGraph Workflow

Create a basic LangGraph workflow that uses SUTRA to process a user query and generate a response with a reasoning step.

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage, SystemMessage
from typing import TypedDict, List

# Define the state schema
class GraphState(TypedDict):
    messages: List[HumanMessage]

# Define a node that processes the query with SUTRA-V2
def chat_node(state: GraphState) -> GraphState:
    messages = state["messages"]
    response = chat.invoke([
        SystemMessage(content="You are a helpful AI that answers concisely in the requested language."),
        *messages
    ])
    state["messages"].append(response)
    return state

# Initialize the graph
workflow = StateGraph(GraphState)

# Add the chat node
workflow.add_node("chat", chat_node)

# Set entry and exit points
workflow.set_entry_point("chat")
workflow.add_edge("chat", END)

# Compile the graph
graph = workflow.compile()

# Run the workflow
initial_state = {"messages": [HumanMessage(content="Explain the benefits of AI in education in Spanish.")]}
result = graph.invoke(initial_state)
print(result["messages"][-1].content)
```

## 🧠 Step 5: Advanced Reasoning with SUTRA-R0 in LangGraph

Use `sutra-r0` to create a multi-step reasoning workflow, such as analyzing a complex query with a reasoning chain.

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage, SystemMessage
from typing import TypedDict, List

# Define the state schema
class ReasoningState(TypedDict):
    messages: List[HumanMessage]
    reasoning_steps: List[str]

# Initialize SUTRA-R0 client
r0_chat = ChatOpenAI(
    model="sutra-r0",
    api_key=api_key,
    base_url="https://api.two.ai/v2"
)

# Node for reasoning step
def reasoning_node(state: ReasoningState) -> ReasoningState:
    messages = state["messages"]
    reasoning_prompt = [
        SystemMessage(content="You are a legal reasoning expert. Break down the query into logical steps before answering."),
        *messages
    ]
    response = r0_chat.invoke(reasoning_prompt)
    state["reasoning_steps"].append(response.content)
    state["messages"].append(response)
    return state

# Initialize the graph
reasoning_workflow = StateGraph(ReasoningState)

# Add the reasoning node
reasoning_workflow.add_node("reason", reasoning_node)

# Set entry and exit points
reasoning_workflow.set_entry_point("reason")
reasoning_workflow.add_edge("reason", END)

# Compile the graph
reasoning_graph = workflow.compile()

# Run the workflow
initial_state = {
    "messages": [HumanMessage(content="If a contract states 'Party A is responsible unless Party B provides notice within 7 days,' who is liable if notice is given on day 8?")],
    "reasoning_steps": []
}
result = reasoning_graph.invoke(initial_state)
print("Reasoning Steps:", result["reasoning_steps"])
print("Final Answer:", result["messages"][-1].content)
```

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

- **Invalid API Key**: Ensure your `SUTRA_API_KEY` is correct and stored securely (e.g., in Colab secrets).
- **Model Not Found**: Verify you’re using `sutra-v2` or `sutra-r0`. SUTRA-V1 was deprecated on March 22, 2025.
- **Graph Errors**: Check that all nodes and edges are properly defined. Ensure `GraphState` or `ReasoningState` matches your workflow’s needs.
- **Rate Limits**: If you hit rate limits, reduce request frequency or contact TWO AI at [https://www.two.ai/support](https://www.two.ai/support).
