title: SUTRA with Portkey
description: Integrate SUTRA models with Portkey for multilingual and reasoning-rich AI applications.
---

This guide walks you through integrating **SUTRA models (V2 or R0)** with **Portkey**. Portkey acts as an AI gateway, providing enhanced observability, reliability, and seamless integration with various AI models, including SUTRA.

## 📦 Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -qU portkey-ai
```

## 🔐 Step 2: Set Up API Keys

Ensure you have the following:

- **Portkey API Key**: Obtain this from your [Portkey Dashboard](https://portkey.ai).
- **SUTRA API Key**: Acquire this from the [SUTRA Platform](https://sutra.two.ai).

Set them as environment variables:

```bash
export PORTKEY_API_KEY="your_portkey_api_key"
export SUTRA_API_KEY="your_sutra_api_key"
```

## ⚙️ Step 3: Initialize Portkey Client with SUTRA

```python
from portkey_ai import Portkey

client = Portkey(
    api_key="your_portkey_api_key",
    virtual_key="your_virtual_key",  # Optional: If using Portkey's virtual keys
    base_url="https://api.two.ai/v2"  # SUTRA's API endpoint
)
```

## 💬 Step 4: Make a Chat Completion Request

```python
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Translate 'Hello, how are you?' to Hindi."}],
    model="sutra-v2"  # Use "sutra-r0" for reasoning tasks
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

## 🧠 Advanced: Utilize SUTRA-R0 for Reasoning

```python
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "If all humans are mortal and Socrates is a human, is Socrates mortal?"}],
    model="sutra-r0"
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

## 📎 Tips

- **Model Selection**:

  - Use `sutra-v2` for tasks like translation, summarization, and multilingual Q&A.
  - Use `sutra-r0` for logical reasoning and analytical tasks.

- **Portkey Features**:
  - **Observability**: Monitor requests and responses seamlessly.
  - **Retries & Fallbacks**: Enhance reliability with automatic retries.
  - **Semantic Caching**: Reduce latency and costs with intelligent caching.
