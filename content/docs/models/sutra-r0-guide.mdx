## 🧠 Build with SUTRA-R0

Welcome to the Build with SUTRA-R0 guide — designed to help developers leverage the advanced reasoning capabilities of SUTRA-R0 in AI agents, decision engines, and complex workflows.

### 🔍 What is SUTRA-R0?

SUTRA-R0 is an advanced reasoning model trained to perform:

- Multi-step logical inference
- Structured problem-solving
- Deep contextual analysis

Perfect for applications in:

- Legal & policy interpretation
- Business intelligence
- Scientific reasoning
- Complex query answering

### 🧪 Quickstart in Python

Install the required packages:

```python
!pip install -qU openai
```

Authenticate with your API key:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url='https://api.two.ai/v2',
    api_key="YOUR_SUTRA_API_KEY"
)
```

Make a basic structured reasoning request:

```python
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model='sutra-r0',
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "If Alice is taller than Bob, and Bob is taller than Carol, who is the tallest?"}
    ],
    max_tokens=512,
    temperature=0.3
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

### 🔁 Comparative Reasoning Example

```python
def compare_reasoning(prompt):
    basic = client.chat.completions.create(
        model='sutra-r0',
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
        temperature=0.3
    )
    advanced = client.chat.completions.create(
        model='sutra-r0',
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
        temperature=0.7,
        presence_penalty=0.6
    )

    print("Basic reasoning:\n", basic.choices[0].message.content)
    print("\nAdvanced reasoning:\n", advanced.choices[0].message.content)

compare_reasoning("Explain the trade-offs between nuclear and solar energy for long-term policy decisions.")
```
