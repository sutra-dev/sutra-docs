## Step 1: Get Started

1. Obtain an API Key: Sign up at [TWO AI SUTRA API](https://www.two.ai/sutra/api).
2. Test on ChatSUTRA: Explore capabilities at [chat.two.ai](https://chat.two.ai).
3. Install Dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install openai
   ```

## Step 2: Basic Usage with SUTRA-V2

```python
from openai import OpenAI

# Initialize SUTRA client
client = OpenAI(
    api_key="YOUR_SUTRA_API_KEY",
    base_url="https://api.two.ai/v2"
)

# Basic chat completion
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="sutra-v2",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful AI."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Explain AI in three sentences in Tamil."}
    ],
    max_tokens=1024,
    temperature=0.7
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

## Troubleshooting

- Invalid API Key: Verify at [TWO AI SUTRA API](https://www.two.ai/sutra/api).
- Model Not Found: Use `sutra-v2` for conversations or `sutra-r0` for reasoning. SUTRA-V1 was deprecated on March 22, 2025.
- Rate Limits: Reduce request frequency.
- Language Issues: Ensure prompts align with the target language’s script and syntax.
